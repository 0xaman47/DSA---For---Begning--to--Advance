## Asymptotic Analysis
- As we know that data structure is a way of organizing the data efficiently and that efficiency is measured either in terms of time or space. So, the ideal data structure is a structure that occupies the least possible time to perform all its operation and the memory space. Our focus would be on finding the time complexity rather than space complexity, and by finding the time complexity, we can decide which data structure is the best for an algorithm.

### Two major fector Depends Asymptotic Analysis :
- Time Complexity
- space complexity
